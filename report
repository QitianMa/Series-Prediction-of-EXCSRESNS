I researched on Excess Reserves of Depository Institutions (EXCSRESNS). This series is non seasonally adjusted. However, later statistical test does not show proof of trend or seasonality. 
First, I did Augmented Dicky-Fuller test, which shows the potential existence of unit root. So I differentiated the data.
From the general plot, I saw no significant trend or seasonality. Later regression on trends and seasonal dummies further confirmed this. 
ACF plot points to AR(1) or AR(3). PACF plots point to MA(1). Auto.arima function points to ARMA(1,3). Therefore, I decided to fit ARIMA(1,0,3) model.
I applied one-step-ahead cross-validation because the general plot shows that cycles do not repeat exactly the same, thus not suitable for train-validation methods. 
Under RMSE criteria, ARRIMA(1,0,3) performs better then Exponential Average (alpha=0.6) as a baseline model. Test???
